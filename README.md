My first project.
Created based on Spring Boot.

The task planner is a web application in which the user can create his own account and enter tasks to be performed, as well as delete or edit them.

All files except .java and .jsp are not mine, they come from the free Spring Boot template (css, etc.)

My code:
/src/main/java/pl/coderslab/
/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/
